# Indian Cricket Legends Recognition System
This project aims to classify images of Indian cricket legends using machine learning techniques. The classifier can recognize and distinguish between different cricket icons based on facial features extracted from the images.

# Overview
The classifier utilizes a combination of image processing and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification results. Here's an overview of the key steps involved:

1.**Image Preprocessing:** The images are preprocessed to enhance features and improve the quality of input data for classification.
2.**Feature Extraction:** Facial features are extracted using Haar cascades for face and eye detection.
3.**Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity and quantity of training data.
4.**Model Training:** Various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are trained on the extracted features.
5.**Model Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6.**Model Deployment:** The best performing model is selected and deployed for real-world usage.
